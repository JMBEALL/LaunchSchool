// Create a function that takes 2 arguments, an array and an object. The array will contain 2 or more elements that, when combined with adjoining spaces, will produce a person's name. The object will contain two keys, "title" and "occupation", and the appropriate values. Your function should return a greeting that uses the person's full name, and mentions the person's title.

function greetings(arr,obj) {
  return `Hello, ${arr[0] + " " + arr[1]}! Nice to have a ${obj.title} ${obj.occupation} around.`;
}

console.log(
  greetings(["John", "Q", "Doe"], { title: "Master", occupation: "Plumber" })
);
// logs Hello, John Q Doe! Nice to have a Master Plumber around.
