// Using the multiply() function from the "Multiplying Two Numbers" problem, write a function that computes the square of its argument (the square is the result of multiplying a number by itself).

let square = num => num ** 2;

console.log(square(5) === 25); // logs true
console.log(square(-8) === 64); // logs true
